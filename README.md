# Spring Boot Demo Application

This application experiments with data from public APIs, using Java 11 and Spring 2.1.6.

This project is mostly to demonstrate my understanding of Spring Boot, including Web and Data JPA modules.
It also consumes data from a public API (JSON Placeholder) as I am aware this is often used as an interview challenge
so I was keen to experiment with this.

Complete list of technologies:

- Use of Java
- Use of Spring Boot
- Use of Spring Boot Web
- Use of Spring Boot Data JPA
- Use of Thymeleaf
- Use of Bootstrap
